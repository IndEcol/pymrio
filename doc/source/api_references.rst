*********************
Data input and output
*********************

Test system
===========

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api_doc/

    load_test

Download MRIO databases
===========================

Download publicly EE MRIO databases from the web.
This is currently implemented for the WIOD_ and EORA26_ database
(EXIOBASE_ requires registration before downloading).


.. _EXIOBASE: http://www.exiobase.eu/
.. _WIOD: http://www.wiod.org/home
.. _EORA26: http://www.worldmrio.com/simplified/

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api_doc/

    download_wiod2013
    download_eora26


Raw data
========

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api_doc/

    parse_exiobase1
    parse_exiobase2
    generic_exiobase12_parser
    parse_wiod
    parse_eora26


Save data
=========

Currently, the full MRIO system can be saved in txt or the python specific
binary format ('pickle'). Both formats work with the same API interface:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.save
   IOSystem.save_all

Already saved MRIO databases can be archived with

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   archive


Load processed data
===================

This functions load IOSystems or individual extensions which
have been saved with pymrio before.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   load
   load_all


Accessing
=========

pymrio stores all tables as pandas DataFrames. This data can be accessed with
the usual pandas methods. On top of that, the following functions return (in
fact yield) several tables at once:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.get_DataFrame
   IOSystem.get_extensions

For the extensions, it is also possible to receive all data (F, S, M, D_cba, ...)
for one specified row.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   Extension.get_row_data

***********************
Exploring the IO System
***********************

The following functions provide informations about the structure of
the IO System and the extensions. The methods work on the IOSystem as well as
directly on the Extensions.


.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.get_regions
   IOSystem.get_sectors
   IOSystem.get_Y_categories
   IOSystem.get_index
   IOSystem.set_index
   Extension.get_rows



************
Calculations
************

Top level methods
===================

The top level level function calc_all checks the IO System and its extensions
for missing parts and calculate these. This function calls the specific
calculation method for the core system and for the extensions.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.calc_all
   IOSystem.calc_system
   Extension.calc_system

Low level matrix calculations
=============================

The top level functions work by calling the following low level functions.
These can also be used independently from the IO System for pandas DataFrames and
numpy array.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   calc_x
   calc_Z
   calc_A
   calc_L
   calc_S
   calc_F
   calc_M
   calc_e
   calc_accounts


*********************************
Metadata and history recording
*********************************


Each pymrio core system object contains a field 'meta' which stores meta data as well as changes to the MRIO system. This data is stored as json file in the root of a saved MRIO data and accessible through the attribute '.meta'.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   MRIOMetaData
   MRIOMetaData.note
   MRIOMetaData.history
   MRIOMetaData.modification_history
   MRIOMetaData.note_history
   MRIOMetaData.file_io_history
   MRIOMetaData.save

*******************************************
Modifiying the IO System and its Extensions
*******************************************

Aggregation
===========

The IO System method 'aggregate' accepts concordance matrices and/or
aggregation vectors. The latter can be generated automatically for various
aggregation levels for the test system and EXIOBASE 2.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.aggregate
   build_agg_vec

Analysing the source of impacts
===============================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   Extension.diag_stressor

Changing extensions
===================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.remove_extension
   concate_extension
   parse_exio12_ext

Renaming
========

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.rename_regions
   IOSystem.rename_sectors
   IOSystem.rename_Y_categories

******
Report
******

The following method works on the IO System (generating reports for every
extension available) or at individual extensions.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.report_accounts

*************
Visualization
*************

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   Extension.plot_account

*************
Miscellaneous
*************

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api_doc/

   IOSystem.reset_to_flows
   IOSystem.reset_to_coefficients
   IOSystem.copy
