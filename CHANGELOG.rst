******************
v0.6.1 - 20250626
******************

New Features
============

* `convert` functions (ioutil.convert, Extension.convert, pymrio.extension_convert) have a new argument
  `reindex` which specifies a order of the converted dataframe/extension. It is a wrapper around pandas reindex,
  but also allows to passing of a bridge column name to sort after the order given in the bridge table.
* we have a logo

Fixes
======

* spelling mistakes in docs
* package data for including classification was missing

******************
v0.6.0 - 20250616
******************


Breaking Changes
================

* The `characterize` function of the extension object has been reimplemented. 
  The updated method generalises the previous approach for region- and sector-specific characterisations. 
  It is closely integrated with the general `characterize` function, enabling characterisation across 
  different extensions (refer to the section under New Features).

* The `get_extensions` function has a revised signature, introducing two new parameters: `names` and `instance_names`.

    - `names`: Enables filtering of extensions by name (either the `.name` attribute or instance names). 
      It also allows passing the extension itself and can be used to harmonise the names within an extension list.
    - `instance_names`: When set to `False`, retrieves the "set names" of the extensions.

    Existing keyword arguments should continue to function with the new signature.

* The behaviour of `remove_extension` has been modified. Previously, all extensions were removed if no name was provided. 
  Now, all extensions are retained when no name is specified, and a `TypeError` is raised. 
  To remove all extensions, use `mrio.remove_extension(mrio.get_extensions())`.

* The `concate_extension` function has been renamed to `extension_concate` for consistency with `extension_convert` and `_characterize`.

* The `concate_extension` argument `name` has been renamed to `new_extension_name`.

New Features
============

* A new top-level `characterize` function has been introduced.

* Extension concatenation functionality is now available as a method of an `mrio` object.

* Added functionality to download and parse the 2023 release of OECD IO tables (contributed by @jaimeoliver1, #132).

* Optional Ghosh implementation for downstream analysis has been added (contributed by @Beckebanze, #136, #146).

    - Equivalent of matrix `A` for Ghosh (referred to as `B` in pymrio).
    - The Ghosh inverse (commonly referred to as `G` in literature).
    - Downstream scope 3 multiplier, `M_{down}`, such that the sum of `M + M_{down}` represents the full scope multiplier. 
      Here, `M` is the existing multiplier in pymrio, covering scopes 1, 2, and 3 upstream.
    - A brief addition to the pymrio background documentation introducing the Ghosh model.
    - Tests verifying the functionality of the added features.

    To utilise this feature, pass `include_ghosh=True` to the `calc_all` or `calc_system` calls.

* Some convenience functions have been added to the MRIO object.
    - sectors ... shortand for `mrio.get_sectors()`
    - regions ... shorthand for `mrio.get_regions()`
    - Y_categories ... shorthand for `mrio.get_Y_categories()`
    - rows ... shorthand for `mrio.extension.get_rows()`
    - extensions ... shorthand for `mrio.get_extensions(instance_names=False)`
    - extensions_instance_names ... shorthand for `mrio.get_extensions(instance_names=True)`
    - DataFrame ... shorthand for `mrio.get_dataframe()`

* New "full" tutorial at https://pymrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/full_tutorial.html

Deprecated
==========

* `extension.get_row_data()`: This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use `extension.extract()` as an alternative.

Miscellaneous
=============

* Documentation has been updated and restructured.

* Multiple warnings related to deprecation in pandas have been resolved.

* Adopted OECD ICIO MRIO column rename to `out` (contributed by @spjuhel, #160).

* Fixed warnings regarding regex characters (contributed by @pcorpet, #155).

* Adopted the Github CI workflows to the newest versions, including (test)PyPI uploads

***************************

New features
============

* added functionality to download and parse 2023 release of OECD IO tables (by @jaimeoliver1, #132)

* Added draft ghosh implementation for downstream analysis (by @Beckebanze , #136)

    - equivalent of A for Ghosh (A* in literature, called As in pymrio)
    - the Ghosh inverse (often referred to G in literature). 
    - downstream scope 3 multiplier, M_{down}, such the sum of the M+M_{down} is the full scope multiplier, with M the existing multiplier in pymrio that covers scope 1,2&3 upstream.
    - a short addition to the pymrio background page that introduces the Ghosh model
    - tests that test the functionality of the added functions
